With Ink, you can build decentralized applications and services that seamlessly connect and collaborate across multiple blockchains on the Polkadot network, enabling a new era of blockchain innovation and connectivity.

### Smoldot Light Client

Traditional blockchain networks often rely on centralized infrastructure, such as full nodes and validators. These centralized points of control can introduce vulnerabilities and dependencies. The Smoldot Light Client, by enabling in-browser access to blockchain data, reduces the need for such centralized infrastructure. Users can interact with the blockchain directly from their web browsers, minimizing reliance on a central authority or service provider.

Typically, the nodes that provide peer-to-peer networking for a blockchain require significant resources, including powerful high-speed processors and high-capacity storage devices. By contrast, light client nodes can synchronize data from the blockchain while running in resource-constrained environments and embedded in applications.

With a light client node, you can interact with a blockchain in a secure and decentralized way without investing in the high-powered hardware and network capacity that running a full node would require.

### Polkadot Connect Extension

Parity is developing wallet extension with Smoldot already built-in so dApp can benefit from it without having to implement Substrate Connect on the dApp client. It is preferable to embed the light client in a browser extension as opposed to directly in the dApp so that multiple browser tabs can share the state of a single instance and sync faster.

When this is ready Substrate dApp Toolkit will leverage its sdk to interact with the blockchain.

## Coding Style Guidelines

At the heart of our development philosophy lies a commitment to crafting clean, maintainable, and efficient code. These guidelines are designed to steer you towards a coding style that is both functional and declarative, promoting collaborative development and an enjoyable coding experience.

Drawing inspiration from Robert C. Martin's book "Clean Code," we've adapted these software engineering principles to the realm of JavaScript. This guide serves as a compass, helping you produce code that is not only readable but also highly reusable and easily refactorable. For an in-depth exploration of these principles in the context of JavaScript, we recommend referring to the [Clean Code JavaScript repository](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript).

Adhering to these guidelines propels your JavaScript software to industry standards, enhancing quality, efficiency, and your development experience.

### JavaScript Conventions

- **Functional and Declarative Code**: Harness the capabilities of modern JavaScript features and TypeScript to craft code that embodies functional and declarative principles. This approach enhances code readability and maintainability, ensuring your codebase remains comprehensible and easy to work with.

- **Meaningful Naming**: Elevate the clarity of your code by employing meaningful and self-explanatory variable and function names. For boolean variables, wield auxiliary verbs like `does`, `has`, `is`, and `should` to illuminate their purpose. For instance, when creating a button component, opt for names such as `isDisabled` or `isLoading` to clearly convey their intended functionality.

- **Component Modularity**: Embrace the concept of component modularity by breaking down larger components into smaller, focused parts with minimal props. Prioritize composability over sprawling monolithic components, promoting a more flexible and maintainable codebase.

- **Collocation**: Foster code organization by collocating related code files within the same directory, especially when they are used exclusively in a specific component. For instance, within the `pages/dashboard` directory, consider placing components, utilities, and hooks that are uniquely associated with that route. Elevate components to the shared folder only when they demonstrate utility across multiple locations or serve as foundational building blocks (e.g., "primitives").

- **File Naming**: Create a cohesive folder structure with lowercase, dash-separated folder names, such as `components/auth-wizard`. Within these folders, adhere to consistent file naming conventions, including extensions like:
  - `.config.ts`
  - `.test.ts`
  - `.context.tsx`
  - `.type.ts`
  - `.page.tsx` (with the file name matching the route name, e.g., `dashboard.page.tsx`)
  - `.hook.ts` (optional, hooks following the `use-something` pattern are easy to identify as such)

Eg: `import { NftItem } from './nft-item`

```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nft-item
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts   ( exports )
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nft-item.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nft-item-header.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nft-item-footer.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nft-item-main.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-nft-item.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nft-item.type.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nft-item.context.tsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nft-item.test.tsx
```

Following this file naming pattern empowers you to swiftly identify each file's type, streamlining your code navigation process. It saves valuable time and enhances your coding efficiency over time.

- **Avoid Hasty Abstractions**: Abstraction is a powerful tool, but it should be wielded judiciously. Avoid rushing into abstractions; instead, introduce them when they organically fit your codebase. Don't shy away from code duplication initially, as it's a stepping stone towards well-considered abstractions. Learn more about this approach in this insightful article by Kent C. Dodds: [Aha Programming](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming).

- **Avoid Default Exports**: Opt for named exports over default exports. Named exports enhance code clarity and maintainability by explicitly specifying the exported items, leaving no room for ambiguity.

- **Infer TypeScript Return Types**: Harness TypeScript's remarkable type inference capabilities to automatically deduce precise return types from your functions. This streamlines your code by reducing boilerplate and maintenance surface.

- **Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO)**: Many functions should adhere to the RORO pattern, where they receive an object as a parameter and return an object as a result. This pattern enhances flexibility and clarity. Here's an example:

```ts
// services/account/account.service.ts
export async function getAccounts({ account, limit = 15, offset = 0 }: GetAccountsParams) {
  // Implementation...
  return { accounts: [] }
}

// types/services.type.ts
export interface ServiceParams {
  limit?: number
  offset?: number
}

// services/account/account.type.ts
export interface GetAccountsParams extends ServiceParams {
  account?: string
}
```

### React Conventions

- **Function Component Declaration**: Declare React components using the `function` keyword for a cleaner syntax and better linting support. ( rules of hooks seem not work well with components declared with const )

- **Use `const` for Methods**: When defining methods within a component, use `const` to cleary differiante them from the components and lib functions.

- **Code Order**: Maintain a consistent code order within your components:

  1. Function component declaration
  2. Styled components
  3. TypeScript types
  4. `getServerSideProps` (if applicable)

- **Ternaries over `&&` in JSX**: When dealing with conditional rendering in JSX, prefer ternaries over `&&` for clarity and readability.

Here's an example of a well-structured React component following these conventions:

```tsx
export function MyReactComponent({ myParam }: MyReactComponentParams) {
  const myMethod = () => console.log(myParam)

  return (
    <div className="bg-slate-100 md:flex">
      A new world awaits. <br /> Be the first to discover it.
      <button onClick={myMethod}>Let's go!</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export interface MyReactComponentParams {
  myParam: boolean
}
```

These guidelines will help maintain code consistency, readability, and collaboration across your project.

### React State Management

When it comes to managing state in your components, thoughtful decisions about the structure and organization of your state variables can significantly impact your code's clarity and maintainability. Here are some guiding principles to help you make informed choices:

#### Use Preact Signals

Consider leveraging Preact Signals, which are reactive primitives designed for efficiently managing application state. Signals enable you to create responsive and well-structured state management in your Preact applications. You can learn more about them [here](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/).

#### Async State Handling

For handling data fetching and asynchronous state flags, embrace tools like `useAsync`, `useAsyncFn`, and `SWR`. These tools simplify asynchronous data management and provide a convenient `{data, isLoading, error}` structure to work with.

#### Group Related State

When multiple state variables are consistently updated together, think about consolidating them into a single state variable. This approach minimizes contradictions within your state and simplifies maintenance.

#### Avoid Redundant State

If you can derive certain information from component props or existing state variables during rendering, avoid duplicating that information in component state. This practice promotes cleaner and more efficient code.

#### Minimize Duplication

Avoid duplicating data between multiple state variables or within nested objects. Duplication complicates data synchronization and can lead to inconsistencies. Strive to reduce redundancy in your state structure.

#### Flatten Nested State

Deeply nested state structures can be cumbersome to update and manage. Whenever possible, opt for a flat state structure. This approach simplifies state updates and enhances code maintainability.

#### Keep State Serializable

To ensure the smooth functioning of features like persistence and time-travel debugging, it's advisable to store only plain serializable objects, arrays, and primitives in your state. While it's technically possible to include non-serializable items, doing so can introduce complexities and potential issues with these essential features.

#### Use Arrays Instead of Maps

When working with state collections, favor arrays over maps. Arrays are more predictable and performant in most cases, contributing to a smoother development experience.

By following these principles and considering the structure and organization of your state variables, you can create a robust and maintainable state management system for your Preact applications. This approach ensures that your code remains easy to update and debug, reducing the chances of introducing bugs and enhancing the overall quality of your application.

### Styling

In the realm of styling, substrate-dapp employs a highly efficient Utility-First approach with TailwindCSS, ensuring a rapid development pace without compromising on quality.

If you're curious about the philosophy behind TailwindCSS, here's a [captivating interview with the founder](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NCNJ3AqEjALX2xza3JKkE?si=ZbnuQrwOT-C4agFxC6yTjg).

**Benefits of Using TailwindCSS**:
